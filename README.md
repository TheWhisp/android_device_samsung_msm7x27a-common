CyanogenMod 11 common device configuration for Samsung MSM7x27A devices

Curently supports:

	1) Galaxy Ace Plus
	2) Galaxy Mini 2

Note: Currently this repo is only designed for Samsung msm7x27a devices which have Gingerbead bootloader and uses
	proprietary blobs from it. What it means is that it includes a lot of device specific things which are not required on newer
	devices (since they have received either official ICS or JB update)  When (if) someone wants to add support for some other device,
	GB-specific hacks will obviously be moved to device-specific repos.
